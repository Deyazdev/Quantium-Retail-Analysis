# Quantium-Retail-Analysis
Project involving analysis of a retail trial in stores 77, 86, and 88 using Python (pandas, scipy, seaborn). I aggregated transaction data, matched control stores via correlation and distance, and conducted t-tests.

See my analysis here: [Quantium Retail Analysis](https://github.com/Deyazdev/Quantium-Retail-Analysis/blob/main/Quantium%20analysis%20.ipynb)

If you're interested in the data preparation and exploration before the analysis could be conducted, you can see that here: [Quantium Data Preparation](https://github.com/Deyazdev/Quantium-Retail-Analysis/blob/main/Quantium%20Data%20preparation%20and%20exploration.ipynb)
